## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains a Test Automation Framework, built using Cypress and Javascript for automated testing for this site: https://www.saucedemo.com/

## 🚀 Key Features
This Cypress project is designed for robust end-to-end testing, incorporating best practices and advanced features to enhance test automation efficiency.
- ✅ Page Object Model (POM) – Organized test structure using reusable page classes to improve maintainability.
- ✅ Data-Driven Testing – Uses external test data for login credentials and other scenarios, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- ✅ Custom Commands – Encapsulates frequently used actions like login to reduce redundancy and improve readability.
- ✅ Advanced Module Integrations:
   - XPath Support – Enables selecting elements using XPath.
   - Cross-Environment Configuration – Allows testing across multiple environments (e.g., production & development) by dynamically setting the base URL.
   - Screenshots & Videos – Automatically captures test evidence for debugging and reporting.
   - Retries on Failures – Configured retries to improve test stability.
   - Test Grouping with Grep – Supports running specific test groups using Cypress grep.
- ✅ Custom Scripts – Optimized package.json scripts for running tests across different browsers, environments, and headless modes.
- ✅ Mochawesome Reporting – Generates detailed, interactive HTML reports with screenshots and logs for better test analysis.
- ✅ CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions:
   - Runs tests automatically on every push & pull request.
   - Scheduled execution Monday to Friday at noon (UTC).
   - Supports manual test execution triggers via GitHub Actions workflow.

|          |-- SauceDemo
|                |-- login.spec.js              # Login test cases
|                |-- product.spec.js            # Product page test cases
|     |-- fixtures
|           |-- request-body
|                |-- login_credentials.json     # Test data
|     |-- reports                               # Stores test execution reports
|     |-- support
|          |-- pages
|                |-- LoginPage.js               # Page Object Model for Login page

```

- `cypress/e2e`: Contains the actual test files. You can organize your tests into subdirectories as needed. 
- `cypress/fixtures`: Contains external files (example: user create/update data) that can be used to mock data during tests.
- `cypress/reports`: Contains the report for tests (Logs are attached).
- `cypress/support`: Contains custom commands and global configuration.
- `cypress/support/utils`: Contains the Utilities that provides methods for asserting different conditions on web elements, handling requests and responses.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Modify `cypress.config.json` for Cypress configuration settings.
- Customize `commands.js` and other files in `cypress/support` for reusable commands.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

This project is configured for CI using Github Actions. Check the configurations in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

## 📊 Reporting

Mochawesome report (Logs are attached) is stored in the `cypress/reports` directory.
